# justHitRecord
I want to record my instruments in an easy and compact format. Just plug in the aux cable, click a button, it records onto an SD card.
While recording an LED lights up and goes dark when the recording finishes.

Current plan:
Jack socket -> PCM ADC -> ESP32 -> SD Breakout board -> SD Card
Additionally, wire a button and an LED to the ESP for controlling.
